# EECE 597 Engineering Demo

## Comparing kinetic models and Bloch simulations for quantitative perfusion imaging with Arterial Spin Labelling

### University of British Columbia - Electrical and Computer Engineering

This repo houses Jupyter notebooks comprising the EECE 597 demo. "Bloch ASL PCASL-GRASE.ipynb" encapsulates the majority of the Bloch simulations prototyped in other notebooks. "Kinetic ASL Model.ipynb" contains a CASL model shown in an interactive plot for adjusting model parameters in real-time. All figures produced for the EECE 597 report can be found in the top-level notebooks.
